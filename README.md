# triskel-law-e

Minimal geometric abstraction inspired by the triskelion.

This repository explores cyclic circulation under constraint using a purely geometric and continuous formulation.
No optimization, objective, learning signal, or control mechanism is implemented.

The purpose is to expose a simple form of bounded circulation where structure persists through motion,
without encoding decision, regulation, or governance logic.

This work is shared as an open research primitive by Neomundi Labs.

## Scope

- Geometry only
- Continuous dynamics
- No AI, no agent, no optimization
- No reversibility guarantee
- No applied use-case

This repository is not a control system.
